# Telecom Churning

### Business Objective
To predict the users churn in the last (i.e. the ninth) month using the data (features) from the first three months.

Three phases of the customer lifecycle,

The ‘good’ phase: In this phase, the customer is happy with the service and behaves as usual.

The ‘action’ phase: The customer experience starts to sore in this phase, for e.g. he/she gets a compelling offer from a competitor, faces unjust charges, becomes unhappy with service quality etc. In this phase, the customer usually shows different behaviour than in the ‘good’ months. Also, it is crucial to identify high-churn-risk customers in this phase, since some corrective actions can be taken at this point (such as matching the competitor’s offer/improving the service quality etc.)

The ‘churn’ phase: In this phase, the customer is said to have churned.
